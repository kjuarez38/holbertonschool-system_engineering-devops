1. Resources

1.1 Network:
The network is the infrastructure that enables communication between various computing devices. It can be wired or wireless, facilitating data transfer among computers, servers, IoT devices, etc.

1.2 Server:
A server is a computer or computing system that provides services, resources, or data to other computers, called clients, over a network. Servers can perform various tasks such as file storage, web request processing, application execution, etc.

1.3 Web Server:
A web server is a type of server that responds to HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests sent by clients, typically web browsers, by serving them web pages, files, or executing scripts.

1.4 DNS (Domain Name System):
DNS is a system used to map domain names (like example.com) to numerical IP addresses. It acts as a phone book for the Internet, translating domain names into IP addresses.

1.5 Load Balancer:
A load balancer is a network device that distributes incoming traffic among multiple servers in a cluster. This improves performance and ensures high availability by evenly distributing the workload.

1.6 Monitoring:
Monitoring involves tracking and analyzing the performance, availability, and integrity of computer systems, networks, and applications. It helps detect potential issues and take corrective actions before they become incidents.

1.7 Database:
A database is a computer system that allows for storing, organizing, and managing data in a structured manner. Databases are widely used in computer applications to store and retrieve information efficiently.

2. Differences between a Web Server and an Application Server
A web server handles HTTP requests and serves static or dynamic files, typically web pages. An application server, on the other hand, is designed to execute more complex business applications. It can interpret programming languages, perform transactions with databases, manage user sessions, etc.

3. DNS Record Types
DNS records define different types of information associated with a domain name. Some common types include:

A: Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.
AAAA: Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address.
CNAME: Alias of one domain name to another (redirect).
MX: Indicates mail servers for the domain.
TXT: Used to store arbitrary textual information.
4. Single Point of Failure
A single point of failure is an element in an IT infrastructure that, if it fails, leads to service unavailability. To avoid this, systems are often designed with redundancies to eliminate single points of failure.

5. Avoiding Downtime when Deploying New Code
To avoid downtime when deploying new code, practices like gradual deployment, automatic rollback, and the use of containers can be implemented. These approaches reduce risks and ensure service continuity.

6. High Availability Cluster (Active-Active/Active-Passive)
A high availability cluster is a group of servers that work together to ensure the continuous availability of an application or service. In an active-active cluster, all nodes are active and serving traffic, while in an active-passive cluster, some nodes remain idle and take over in case of failure.

7. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
HTTPS is a secure extension of the HTTP protocol. It uses SSL/TLS encryption to secure data exchanged between the web browser and the web server, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of the information.

8. Firewall
A firewall is a device or software that controls and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of predefined rules. It is used to protect networks against unauthorized access and malicious attacks.

That concludes our course on the fundamentals of computer development, focusing on resources, servers, networks, and application availability. Feel free to ask if you have any questions!
