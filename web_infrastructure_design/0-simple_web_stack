##Specifics about the Infrastructure:

1.What is a server?
A server is a computer system or software that provides functionality or services to other programs or devices, known as clients, within a network.

2.Role of the domain name:
A domain name is a human-readable address used to access websites. It translates to an IP address and helps users easily locate and identify websites on the internet.

3.Type of DNS record www in www.foobar.com:
The DNS record for "www" in www.foobar.com is typically a CNAME (Canonical Name) record, which points to the domain name foobar.com.

4.Role of the web server:
The web server (Nginx in this case) handles incoming HTTP requests from clients, serves web pages, and manages static content delivery to users' browsers.

5.Role of the application server:
The application server executes the application logic, processes dynamic content, and interacts with databases to generate personalized responses based on user requests.

6.Role of the database:
The database (MySQL) stores and manages structured data for the website. It facilitates data retrieval, storage, and manipulation based on application requirements.

7.Communication with the user's computer:
The server communicates with the user's computer over the internet using protocols like HTTP or HTTPS to deliver web content and responses to user requests.


##Issues with the Infrastructure:

1.SPOF (Single Point of Failure):
The infrastructure has a single server hosting all components. If this server fails, the entire website becomes inaccessible, leading to a single point of failure.

2.Downtime during maintenance:
When maintenance tasks like deploying new code require restarting the web server, it can result in downtime where users cannot access the website or experience interruptions in service.

3.Scalability limitations with high traffic:
Due to the single-server setup, the infrastructure may struggle to handle a large volume of incoming traffic efficiently. This limitation makes it challenging to scale resources to meet increased demand effectively.
